This code calculates the photodetachment rate for a negative ion subjected to
either the quiet or active solar photon spectrum, as descibed in the publication:

Desai, RT, Zhang, Z., Wu, X., Lue, C., (2021) Photodetachment and Test-Particles Simlations Constraints on Negative Ions in Solar System Plasmas, Planetary Science Journal, doi:XXXX

The code requires the Electron Affinity in eV and Assymptotic cross-section in cm^2
as inputs and uses the method described in Huebner et al. (1992) and Millar et al. (2007)
